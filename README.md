## Why the name "MentalCrash"?

Well, before i even started on the project, i was thinking of different name to give my project, but then i thought of a user who is getting mentally mad while they debug something, and then imagining them getting mad to the point of going insane and needing to crash off (aka, chill), so yeah, "MentalCrash" :)
