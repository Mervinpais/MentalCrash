## What is MentalCrash?
MentalCrash is an (Esoteric) Programming language created by me, Mervin14. I made this as a challenge to create a programming language that is intentionally confusing for myself.

## Why "MentalCrash"?

Well, before i even started on the project, i was thinking of different name to give my project, but then i thought of a user who is getting mentally mad while they debug something, and then imagining them getting mad to the point of going insane and needing to crash off (aka, chill), so yeah, "MentalCrash" :)

## Update Timeperiod?

probably 1 once a month, then also may just be a patch or minor version, major versions will take 3-4 months (my guess)

# Other FAQ

## Could you make a program completely in one line?

here is the link for the python random code generator for mental crash, the thing is, this generates code that runs on one line ONLY :O :skull:
